# Crop-Yield-Prediction-System
Key features of the pipeline:

Classification using three models (Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Regression for yield prediction
K-means clustering for pattern detection
Built-in preprocessing with StandardScaler
Performance metrics tracking (accuracy, RMSE)

The pipeline achieves 87% classification accuracy.

Developed ML pipeline with Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers (87% accuracy), regression models (0.85 RMSE), and K-means clustering for agricultural pattern detection
